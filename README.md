# Our-Second-Neural-Network
This time fully function, this is the second take at making a Neural Network that can identify handwritten digits using Python 3.5.

Our Network uses a Feedforward Neural Network and Stochastic Gradient Descent to compute the error in prediction of the digits in the form of partial derivatives of the weights and biases in the network and tweak those for each training sample during the training session.

The network achieves around 94% accuracy each time we train it using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

This work was done by following the book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com by Michael Nielsen.
